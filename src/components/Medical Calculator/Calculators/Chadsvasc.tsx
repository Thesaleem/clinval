                Anion gap test is used to check the pH balance of the blood. It
                indicates if the blood is too acidic or basic. The anion gap measures
                the difference between the negatively charged and positively charged
                electrolytes in the blood. Too high means the blood is more acidic
                than normal and too low means it isnâ€™t acidic enough. Both conditions
                can be serious.
